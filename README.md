## An Exploration of temperature and solar radiation using WorldClim2 database
### Abstract
This project used the WorldClim 2 database to explore the relationship between solar radiation and temperature. The WorldClim 2 Historical climate data contains aggregated data for maximum temperature, minimum temperature, solar radiation, precipitation, and wind speed from all over the world for the period 1970-2000. This project mainly tested some theories, for example, verifying common knowledge that when solar radiation is concentrated in smaller surface areas, it causes temperatures torise; verifying classical models that use temperature to predict solar radiation. I use ablation studies and linear regression to delve into the relationships between maximum temperature, minimum temperature, temperature range, solar radiation, latitude, and longitude.
